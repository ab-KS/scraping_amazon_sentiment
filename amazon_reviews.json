                    "review_text": "I purchased it for Rs 2K. Given the price, I do not recommend or advise otherwise. I have listed below my experience with this watch. This will help buyers making informed buying choice.Pros:1. Big enough and looks good.2. Companion App with  your rank in your city and globally.3. Ability to send data to standard goole health app.4. Enough sports mode with parameters like aerobic training effect and required cooling time, step length etc. It gives you more insight about exercise.5. Custom watch face. Though it gives basic information only. Choosing display values would have been better.6. Mostly accurate steps, heart beat rate and SpO2. However, I find it gives lesser steps and distance covered if you walk fast. The gap is about 10%.7. Senses activity and prompts you to start tracking.8.Alexa for weather update etc.9. Music and camera control from watch.10. Enough bright under  sun at 100% nits.11. I assume data, micro code and app code control lies with fastrack(Tata). Better than giving data in control of Chinese companies.12. Silicon strap is good.13. Control of apps that can send messages to watch and display is good enough.14. The microphone and speaker are very good. You can really make good calls with this watch.15. Battery runs for 2-3 days with all tracking on and 60% brightness.Cons:1. The biggest issue is that automatic functions like spo2, sleep, stress etc. stop abruptly. Several times it did not record sleep, her, stress at all. I feel if you restart the watch everyday, it still works better.2. Sleep tracker gives basic values and looks like it  works for a specific period only. If you wake once even for nature's call, it stops tracking sleep. Overall, it's useless.3. Alexa disconnects automatically and needs to be setup again. Not sure if this is alexa app or something else but the user experience for this function is not that pleasant due to this issue4. The knob doesn't have scroll function. It rotates for nothing.5. Requires tight fitting to track values making it inconvenient to wear it for longer periods.6. Tucking the strap inside is inconvenient. Some other brands also have the same but it is not good for men with hairs on hand and watch requiring tight fit to track values. A conventional loop would be better.7. If you accidently replace a watch face with your custom face, it is impossible to bring it back. I am unable not find a way so far.8. No amoled screen. I personally do not think it is required for watch.In summary, if you do not rely on automatic functions and can provide manual inputs, not keen on tracking sleep and live with cons, it is worth a buy at this price tag else not.",

Other apps like WhatsApp, massage, should be install to read and reply.4. Hindi fort reading option should be given.",

Step counter is not accurate.2. Sleep tracking is quite accurate.3. Device doesn't have Screen Lock feature.

With its sleek design and customizable watch faces, it caters to a variety of tastes. The watch boasts a range of fitness tracking features, including heart rate monitoring, step counting, and sleep tracking, which can provide valuable insights into your health and well-being.The FS1's battery life is commendable, allowing you to use it throughout the day without frequent charging. Its compatibility with both Android and iOS devices ensures that most users can take advantage of its features without any compatibility issues. The inclusion of notifications for calls, messages, and social media updates helps you stay connected without needing to constantly check your phone.However, as with any smartwatch, there might be some room for improvement. Users might find the touch screen responsiveness a bit lacking at times, and the app ecosystem might not be as extensive as some other competitors. Additionally, the watch's accuracy in terms of health metrics can sometimes be a bit off compared to dedicated medical devices.In conclusion, the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 smartwatch offers a well-rounded package for those looking for a stylish and functional wearable. It's particularly suitable for individuals who want to keep track of their fitness goals and stay connected on the go. Just keep in mind its minor drawbacks and make sure they align with your needs and expectations.",

I've had the chance to test out this product for a while now, and I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed.First of all, let's talk about the display. The biggest 1.95\" Horizon Curve Display is simply stunning. It's crystal clear and easy to read, even in bright sunlight. And the fact that it's a curved display means that you get an even better viewing experience.The watch also features SingleSync BT Calling v5.3, which means that you can take calls and talk to people directly from your wrist. It's incredibly convenient, and I love not having to take my phone out of my pocket every time I receive a call.Another fantastic feature is the built-in Alexa. With Alexa, you can ask for the weather, set reminders, and even control your smart home devices, all with just your voice. It's a great addition that makes the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 Smart Watch even more useful.And let's not forget about the battery life. With a mega 7-day battery, you won't have to worry about constantly charging your watch. This is especially important if you're someone who's always on the go and doesn't have time to charge their devices constantly.The ATS Chipset with Zero Lag is also a standout feature. The watch runs smoothly and quickly, and I've never experienced any lag or delays.With over 100 sports modes and 150+ watchfaces, the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 Smart Watch has something for everyone. Whether you're a runner, swimmer, or weightlifter, you'll find a sports mode that suits your needs. And with so many watchfaces to choose from, you can customize your watch to your heart's content.Overall, I highly recommend the Fastrack New Limitless FS1 Smart Watch. It's packed with features, has an impressive battery life, and looks great on your wrist. If you're in the market for a new smartwatch, this one should definitely be at the top of your list.",

With Bluetooth mostly off, I got 4 days of battery time (58% to 17%). Charged to 93%, all day Bluetooth and calls, every 5 minutes health monitoring on, battery lasted for almost 3.75 days (93% to 17%).- Many features, but rarely you are going to use much.- a handy calculator is a plus. But I found some difficulty in calculating more numbers. Like, 12345+2345+345.....- smooth functioning- local songs on tws is easy and better- mic and speaker are better- 4gb memory is really fantasticNegatives -These are not actually negative points. But there is a room for improvement in these issues.- You will never be able to listen to local songs on tws, in addition to getting calls. Example, SW is connected with your headphone. You play songs on headphone. At this time your SW will not be connected to Phone. So you can't get calls on SW.Same way, if you are connected with phone Bluetooth, you can't listen to local songs on headphone.- your steps get counted while driving. Even if you go to sports mode and select driving now. It will count steps. That adds it to total day steps and your calculations goes wrong.- there is no option to turn off call ringer, except puting it on DND.- While on local mode, it should just show calls, I found that it is automatically picking calls within a sec of call received. (I will need to check this again)- 500 sports mode is useless thing. One should be able to select the required modes on app. Only those will be shown on the SW. Otherwise you need 5 minutes to find the correct mode for you.- add stress measurement sensor- not showing main screen when you have a password protection on. Just shows time.- double tap to on screen is a much required feature for SW.- improvement in app required",

Now I am bit worried about the after sales services because all the Play Store users put negative reviews and application rating is below 3 starts, even though there is no response from company's side. App doesn't have Google fit connect or any thing like that, I don't know what the use of that app. It's only useful for Bluetooth calling and call notification. If you're okay with mobile application please go ahead and purchase this watch, because watch is good.",
